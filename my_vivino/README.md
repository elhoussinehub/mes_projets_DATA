# Welcome to My Vivino

## Task
The objective of this project is to analyze a wine dataset and build a simple recommendation system based on wine characteristics.
The main challenge is to transform raw data into meaningful insights by properly cleaning, processing, and comparing data, while ensuring reliable and interpretable results.
## Description
This project follows a structured data science workflow implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (my_vivino.ipynb):
Exploring and summarizing the dataset to understand its structure and content
Cleaning the data by removing invalid or irrelevant values
Visualizing distributions to better interpret the data
Scaling numerical features to ensure fair comparisons
Computing similarities between wines using cosine similarity
Generating wine recommendations based on similarity scores
Special attention was given to code clarity, logical organization, and robustness, making the notebook easy to read, reuse, and extend.
## Installation
To run this project locally:
Clone the repository
Make sure you have Python 3 installed
Install the required Python libraries (if not already available):
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
No additional system dependencies are required.
## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step:
jupyter notebook my_vivino.ipynb
The notebook will guide you through data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and recommendation generation.
All results, plots, and recommendations are displayed directly within the notebook.
