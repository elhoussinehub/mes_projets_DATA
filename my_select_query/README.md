## Task

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that processes input data and produces meaningful output based on specific rules.
The main challenge is ensuring the program handles all possible edge cases while remaining efficient and easy to maintain.

## Description

To solve this problem, the project was structured into clear modules.
Each module is responsible for a specific functionality, making the code more readable and easier to debug.
I implemented step-by-step validation, error handling, and testing to ensure the solution behaves correctly in different scenarios.

## Installation

To install and prepare the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your machine.

Install dependencies using the appropriate command for your environment:

npm install for JavaScript projects

make or make re for C projects

pip install -r requirements.txt for Python projects

Ensure all required tools or libraries are installed on your system.

## Usage

To run the project, use the command below and replace the arguments with your own inputs:

./my_project argument1 argument2


The program will then process your input and display the result in the terminal.
